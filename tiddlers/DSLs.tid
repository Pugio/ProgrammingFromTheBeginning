Domain Specific Language

Why Is This a Thing?
You're always making domain specific languages. (Paul Graham quote about this, or lisp, or something).
Think of an inside joke between friends â€“ you're using English, but you can convey so much more, so quickly. Concise and meaningful.

Create clear example of DSL > raw code.
Library system?
Cash register?
A game? (maybe, but those text based rooms are not familiar to many people, maybe a sport?)
