This book will teach you to be a programmer. It is a map, a guide, and a tutorial, and its main goal is to give you the confidence to keep learning. It will teach you a language, show you a set of skills, introduce you to the main concepts in programming, and, above all, teach you how to find help and good answers when you're stuck.

Computers are used everywhere â€“ in this book we'll be using web development as a guiding focus. You'll learn about programming in general, and all the extra bits needed to build web sites.
